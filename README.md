# Mobile-Final-RNT
Mobile final project by Richard Hamer, Nolan Shaw and Tao He


## The Embedded System (see Embedded Branch)

The embedded system will consist of a minimum of 4 components: an ESP32 board, a Red LED, an appropriate resistor (say 220 ohms), and a DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor.


## The Android Application (see Master Branch)

The android application will monitor and display the temperature and humidity data sent by the embedded device. The data will be displayed via TextViews on the applications main page using a simple UI. The UI will also allow the user to set the threshold for triggering the alarm on the ESP32 board.
